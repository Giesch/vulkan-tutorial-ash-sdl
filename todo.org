#+title: Todo

* Next
- [X] add shader hot reload
  - [X] inotify file watcher
  - [X] recompile
  - [X] rebuild pipeline w/new shader modules
  - [X] easy example

- [ ] add shader printf

- [ ] read about dynamic rendering
  - [ ] sascha's 1.3 triangle

- [ ] signed distance fields
   https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/code-animated-rick/

- [ ] rewrite renderer in a new repo
  - use a cargo workspace
    make it easy to keep multiple working examples
  - group one-time initialized fields into a sub-struct w/methods
  - group sync primitive arrays with their resources in some way
    ie make it clear what's per-swapchain-image vs per-in-flight-frame
  - use anyhow for errors
  - use an env var for vulkan validation layer
    https://github.com/ash-rs/ash/issues/190#issuecomment-758269723
    maybe for logging too? ie always compile w/verbose
  - also switch to dynamic rendering?
    in the future, try out bindless with slang support
  - avoid runtime mipmap generation
    use an build task

* Future
- [ ] make a spinning cube from scratch in slang

- [ ] try generating Vertex struct via slang reflection

- [ ] vulkan-tutorial extras
  - [ ] compute shader

- [ ] look at Sascha Willems' other examples
- [ ] move on to https://vkguide.dev/ ?
  - use egui w/ash crate

- [ ] consider adding a separate queue & command buffer for memory transfer
  https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/04_Vertex_buffers/02_Staging_buffer.html#_transfer_queue

- [ ] learn how to use a gpu memory allocator
  particularly the two crates the ash egui crate integrates with
- [ ] start recreating bevy 2d platformer with this tech stack?

- [ ] find out if hot-reloading pipeline code is possible
  ie, use lifecycle methods from

- [ ] understand stage & access masks better
  - [ ] review usage in ImageMemoryBarrier & in SubpassDependency
  re: creating framebuffers using the same depth image:
  "The color attachment differs for every swap chain image, but the same depth image can be used by all of them because only a single subpass is running at the same time due to our semaphores."
  so we'd need to do a depth image per swapchain image if there were multiple subpasses using them?
  how does SDL3_gpu handle that?
- [ ] review how barriers are used in the mipmap chapter

- [ ] try out using draw indirect & gpu culling

- [ ] generate build-time mipmaps
  - [ ] generate & use separate half-sized files with image-rs
  - [ ] combine & use into one packed sheet

- [ ] regenerate reflection structs during hot reload

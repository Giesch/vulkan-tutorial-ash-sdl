#+title: Docs Notes

- descriptorRanges renamed to bindingRanges
  and 'descriptorRange' vec
- 'buildering' class
- addRanges vs addDescriptorRanges?
  be consistent with bindingRanges (or something else)

- this bit has multiple wrong names in it, to the point I have no idea what's going on
  addRanges is also add_descriptor_ranges_for_parameter_block_element?
  and they left out the automatically added uniform buffer handling
  #+begin_src slang
    void DescriptorSetLayoutBuilder::addRanges(
        slang::TypeLayoutReflection* typeLayout)
    {
        addDescriptorRanges(typeLayout);
        pipelineLayoutBuilder->addSubObjectRanges(typeLayout);
    }
